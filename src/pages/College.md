  <summary>School Performance</summary>
  <div>
    <div>•	Your high school performance is a factor that can have a major impact on your college selection
•	This performance is often gauged using GPA which students are typically given access to see and evaluate in their own way 
•	A high GPA useful to help a student’s chances of getting into their desired college especially more prestigious schools who might have lot of work demand from their students and expect only the most dedicated and hardworking of students in their ranks
•	Most colleges typically tend to select students within a certain range of GPA scores however these scores are generally more like suggestions as overall selection is also based on other factors like extracurriculars and standardized testing
•	If you come from a school district that does not allow students to see their actual GPA or any kind of class rank system, then you can use this GPA calculator (add your GPA calculator here) tool as a rough estimate of where you stand
•	Keep in mind that this tool isn’t perfect and should be taken with a grain of salt, but it is still a good way to at least estimate your performance and where you can improve it

•	For most high school students college is the ultimate goal and destination, but what they need to get from high school in order to go to their dream college is often less clear and much harder to figure out
•	Here we aim to provide vital information that will help students get a rough understanding of what requirements they need to meet to reach their desired college and what aspects of their current performance can be improved to better their chances
•	This is not to say that we consider this a guide for getting into college but simple a framework of important details students need to keep in mind as they go through high school and prep for college and students should also seek advice from their counselors and teachers when it comes to college admissions

<details>
  <summary>Standardized testing</summary>
  <div>
    <div>Another vital element of college admissions is standardized testing in the forms of tests like the SAT and ACT
•	The reasons these tests are important is because they can help students get ahead in the college selection process so the other elements of their application can shine
•	For example, a college that receives hundreds of applications may set a cutoff based on the SAT scores for the students whose applications they received so students with a high SAT score are inherently at an advantage over their peers 
•	Whether to take the SAT or the ACT is ultimately a student’s choice and they should chose the test they are more comfortable with based on the individual details from both tests and what the student feels most apt to handle 
•	For more information about the pros and cons of the SAT and ACT as well as more details about how it may impact a student’s college selection chances use this article <a href="https://www.collegeraptor.com/getting-in/articles/act-sat/why-is-the-actsat-so-important/">Click here</a>for some general idea of how both tests work and their fundamental differences

  <summary>Extra Ciriculars</summary>
  <div>
    <div>Many colleges apply a “holistic” selection process where the student’s grades, and standardized scores will have just as much weight as the activities and positions the student has engaged with
•	This is because they can show skills and traits of a student that aren’t necessarily indicated by their GPA or standardized testing scores.
•	Importantly most colleges are typically looking for extracurriculars that indicate some form of: 
-	Drive
-	Commitment
-	Time management 
-	Talent 
-	Interest
Whether or not a student posse and these traits can be displayed by simply seeing how they interact with their extracurriculars over time. 
•	Additionally, thanks to most colleges having an extremely lax definition of extracurricular activities a student shouldn’t be hard pressed to come up with many examples of extracurricular involvement. 
•	For more details about extracurricular activities please see this article <a href="https://admissions.usf.edu/blog/do-extracurriculars-matter-in-the-college-admissions-process">click here</a>
