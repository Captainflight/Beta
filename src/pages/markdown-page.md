•	We also provide access to notion where students will be able to set up an account and track their work through the calendar and tools provided by Notion
•	If you don’t know how to use notion that’s perfectly fine here is a simple tutorial on how to navigate the interface and a short video on how to use the application

HOW TO USE NOTION?

-	Notion while appearing intimidating at first is actually quite a simple yet versatile calendar tool which can greatly help students space out and organize their workload 
-	All one needs to do is create a notion account using a personal email so they can get access to the site and its tools 
-	From there they will then haver the option to create a personal workspace where they can use the tools and tutorials provided by notion to help organize themselves and track their work and progress
